    <richText>Here is a useful list to show how far money donated to Running Chicken can go.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;$5 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;a bed net (lasts five years) to prevent malaria.  Malaria is the leading cause of death for children in Kenya. Proper use of insecticide-treated bed nets is the most effective malaria prevention measure available at this time.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;$10 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;a book for the library at the home and resource center for vulnerable children&lt;i&gt;.&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;$25 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;a school uniform including shoes to ensure that the inability to pay this mandatory expense does not prevent a child from going to school&lt;i&gt; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;$50 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;three months of medical care for all 14 residents of the home and resource center for vulnerable children&lt;i&gt; &#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;$100 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;New pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils for the outreach feeding program that serves more than 600 students and children in the community&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&#xD;&#xA0;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;$200 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;8 complete school uniforms, including shoes.  While primary education is free in Kenya, school uniforms are mandatory and present a prohibitive cost to families living in poverty.&#xD;&#xA0;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;$1000 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;Six months of meals for more than 600 students.  For students at Dago Thim Primary school &#x2013; many of whom walk more than 2km to and from school - this lunch is sometimes the only reliable meal of the day.&#xD;&#xA0;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;$15,000 can buy:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;A year of operating expenses for the home and resource center for vulnerable children.  The current 14 residents and other at-risk children in the community visit the center for basic living, medical and educational resources. Meeting this goal ensures that the needs of these children are met.&#xA0;</richText>
