      <description>Here is a useful list to show how far money donated to Running Chicken can go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$5 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;a bed net (lasts five years) to prevent malaria.  Malaria is the leading cause of death for children in Kenya. Proper use of insecticide-treated bed nets is the most effective malaria prevention measure available at this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$10 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;a book for the library at the home and resource center for vulnerable children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$25 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;a school uniform including shoes to ensure that the inability to pay this mandatory expense does not prevent a child from going to school &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$50 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;three months of medical care for all 14 residents of the home and resource center for vulnerable children &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$100 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;New pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils for the outreach feeding program that serves more than 600 students and children in the community &lt;br/&gt;&#xA0;&lt;br/&gt;$200 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;8 complete school uniforms, including shoes.  While primary education is free in Kenya, school uniforms are mandatory and present a prohibitive cost to families living in poverty.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA0;&lt;br/&gt;$1000 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;Six months of meals for more than 600 students.  For students at Dago Thim Primary school &#x2013; many of whom walk more than 2km to and from school - this lunch is sometimes the only reliable meal of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA0;&lt;br/&gt;$15,000 can buy:&lt;br/&gt;A year of operating expenses for the home and resource center for vulnerable children.  The current 14 residents and other at-risk children in the community visit the center for basic living, medical and educational resources. Meeting this goal ensures that the needs of these children are met.&#xA0;</description>

      <title>Why Two Blogs?</title>

      <description>In our attempt to be transparent, while still having all the technical skills of a history teacher, we have decided that the easiest, cleanest way to be transparent is to archive all of our old documents, discussions, meeting notes, and emails to a single Transparency blog.  Information updates will happen on a sporadic basis by Jessica Chacon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second one will be focused on updates and news.  It will be written roughly twice a week by Catherine Leys.  (Clearly these first two entries were written by Jessica.)</description>

      <description>We are rebooting this site!  We have changed our name, are redesigning the logo, and setting up new fundraisers.  We are still the same organization - working to help support the efforts of the Children&#x2019;s Rescue Mission, health initiatives and job-training for widows in Kisumu, Kenya.  Our goal is still to be a transparent organization, so you can see how decisions are made and how money is used.  We will continue to post photo updates from Kenya.</description>
